You have 2 ways to change text. Either by right clicking on the field and changing the case or by highlighting and only changing what you highlighted. Keyboard Shortcut available in version 2.0!

Bug Found: It seems sometimes the ALT Keyboard shortcuts don't work. It could be due to the newer version of Firefox. I will be fixing this soon as soon as i can figure out why it stopped working.

KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS All you have to do is right click and select TitleCase -> Allow ALT Shortcut. This will enable it forever, until you shut it off.

I have noticed a couple people putting bugs into reviews. That is fine, but I take my time to edit and fix these bugs and yet they leave the low star review without explanation after I fixed. It would be really nice to let me know so I can fix the issue if you would submit a ticket instead, that way you can be notified.

New 3.0 Update: Wanted to let you know this is a full rewrite using the new WebExtension format. I was going to use the jQuery Library to help with this, but I feel like it will cause more trouble than what it is worth. So, I am writing it in pure Javascript just like version 2.0 but instead in WebExtension format. There is a context menu to allow for you to turn off the ALT Keys.

Permissions
This add-on can:
- Access your data for all websites (This is to allow access to text on each page)
- Access browser tabs (This is to allow context menu to make changes to highlighted text)

Note: Please do not post bugs or problems in review as I will actively fix them.
